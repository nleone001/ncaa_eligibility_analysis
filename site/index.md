## About This Project

This project analyzes 25 years of NCAA Wrestling All-American data. The workflow is fully reproducible: run the analysis script to regenerate charts and tables; the site consumes those outputs only.

### Quick Stats

- **2,000** All-American finishes analyzed  
- **1,076** unique wrestlers  
- **26** tournament years (2000–2025)

### Reproducibility

To regenerate all charts and tables:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python notebooks/analysis.py
```

Outputs are written to `charts/` and `tables/`. Only content under `site/` is intended for the published site.
