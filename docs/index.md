# NCAA Wrestling Eligibility Analysis

A data-driven analysis of NCAA Division I Wrestling All-Americans from 2000–2025, focusing on eligibility year patterns. All analysis is performed in Python; charts and tables are generated by the pipeline and consumed here.

## Core Reports

|--------|-------------|
| [**Report 01: Experience vs Youth — All-Americans by Eligibility**](reports/report_01_overview.html) | Who makes the podium? How does experience impact national titles and All-American honors? 25 years of trends. |
| [**Report 02: The Journey (Career Arc)**](reports/report_02_placeholder.html) | Multi-AA funnel, aesthetic progressions, career-arc analyses. |
| [**Report 03: Bracket/Year Seed/Placement Stats**](reports/report_03_seed_placement.html) | Seed-placement differentials, bracket unpredictability, and year-level seeding statistics. |
| [**Report 04: Team Performance**](reports/report_04_teams.html) | Seed-performance differential by school (over/underperform), and top 10 schools by All-Americans and national titles. |

## About This Project

This project analyzes 25 years of NCAA Wrestling All-American data. The workflow is fully reproducible: run the analysis script to regenerate charts and tables; the site consumes those outputs only.

### Quick Stats

- **2,000** All-American finishes analyzed
- **1,076** unique wrestlers
- **26** tournament years (2000–2025)

### Reproducibility

To regenerate all charts and tables:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python notebooks/analysis.py
```

Outputs are written to `charts/` and `tables/` in the repo.
