# Report 02: The Journey

## Development and career arc

*What does the path from freshman All-American to senior champion actually look like?*

This report explores multi-time All-Americans, aesthetic progressions (improvement every year), and related career-arc analyses. We start with the funnel: how many of the 1,076 unique wrestlers who have ever AA'd went on to do it again—and again?

## Multi-AA funnel

Of **{{ site.data.report_02_stats.n_unique_wrestlers }}** unique wrestlers who have placed at the NCAA tournament (2000–2025), **{{ site.data.report_02_stats.n_multi_aa }}** have All-Americaned more than once. The funnel below shows how many reached each tier (2×, 3×, 4×, or 5× AA).

![Funnel: unique wrestlers by multi-AA tier (All → 2× → 3× → 4× → 5× AA)]({{ site.baseurl }}/charts/multi_aa_funnel.png)

*Unique wrestlers by multi-AA tier. Top: all 1,076; then wrestlers with 2+ AAs (548), 3+ (266), 4+ (103), 5+ (7).*

- **All wrestlers:** {{ site.data.report_02_stats.n_unique_wrestlers }} unique wrestlers (at least one AA)
- **2× AA:** {{ site.data.report_02_stats.funnel.n_2plus }} wrestlers
- **3× AA:** {{ site.data.report_02_stats.funnel.n_3plus }} wrestlers
- **4× AA:** {{ site.data.report_02_stats.funnel.n_4plus }} wrestlers
- **5× AA:** {{ site.data.report_02_stats.funnel.n_5plus }} wrestlers

Roughly half of all wrestlers who ever AA'd did it more than once; only a small group (7) reached five or more All-American finishes.

*Additional sections (aesthetic progressions, multi-weight success, defending champions, last-chance seniors, Super Senior performance) will be added as the analysis is completed.*
