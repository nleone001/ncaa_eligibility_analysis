# Report 02: Summary Tables by Eligibility

*Placeholder for the second core report.*

This page will contain totals and percentage shares by eligibility class (e.g. from `tables/eligibility_summary.md` or equivalent), with brief commentary. Content will be added when the pipeline exports the required tables and the report is written.
