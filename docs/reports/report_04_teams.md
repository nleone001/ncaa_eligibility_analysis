# By the Numbers: Team Performance in NCAA Wrestling

**Which programs over- or underperform their seeds? Which schools have produced the most All-Americans and national champions?**

This report groups the data by school and examines (1) seed–performance differential—which teams consistently beat or fall short of their seeds—and (2) the top programs by total All-Americans and by national titles (2000–2025).

## Executive Summary

- **Seed–performance differential** is the sum of (Place − Seed) across all of a school’s All-Americans. Positive means the program tends to place better than seeded; negative means they tend to place worse. We restrict to schools with at least 15 AAs so the list reflects sustained performance rather than small-sample noise.
- **All-Americans** and **National Championships** are shown as **top 10** tables. Cumulative line charts show how the **top 4** schools by each measure built their totals over 2000–2025.

## Seed–Performance Differential

A wrestler who was seeded 4th and placed 1st has a differential of +3 (outperformed seed). One seeded 1st who placed 3rd has −2 (underperformed). Summing these by school shows which programs, on balance, exceed or fall short of expectations set by seeding.

The chart below shows every school with at least 15 All-Americans, ordered by differential (descending): strongest overperformers at the top, strongest underperformers at the bottom. Positive values (right) = overperform vs seed; negative (left) = underperform.
